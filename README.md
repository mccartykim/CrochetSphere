# CrochetSphere
Simple web page script to make a crocheted sphere pattern

I found this hobby program I wrote back in my community college days, and wanted to clean it up a bit.  It works, and shows I was very enthused to do something with geometry and crochet, but I really cringe at how I describe how it works, what I named my variables, and so on.

I really hope I can especially make that prettyPrintRow function something more readable!  Yikes!
